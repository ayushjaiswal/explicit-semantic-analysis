Title: Bleeding into the skin

Bleeding under the skin can occur from broken blood vessels that form tiny pinpoint red dots (called petechiae). Blood also can collect under the tissue in larger flat areas (called purpura), or in a very large bruised area (called an ecchymosis).

Subtopic: Considerations
Aside from the common bruise, bleeding into the skin or mucous membranes is a very significant sign and should always be checked out by a health care provider.Redness of the skin (erythema) should not be mistaken for bleeding. Areas of bleeding under the skin do not become pale (blanch) when you press on the area. The redness of erythema decreases when you apply pressure to it and returns when release the pressure.

Injury or traumaAllergic reactionAutoimmune disordersViral infection or illness affecting blood coagulationThrombocytopeniaMedical treatment, including radiation and chemotherapyAntiplatelet medications such as clopidogrel (Plavix)Bruise (ecchymosis)Birth (petechiae in the newborn)Aging skin (ecchymosis)Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (petechiae and purpura)Henoch-Schonlein purpura (purpura)Leukemia (purpura and ecchymosis)Drugs 

Anticoagulants such as warfarin or heparin (ecchymosis)Aspirin (ecchymosis)Steroids (ecchymosis)Septicemia (petechiae, purpura, ecchymosis)

Subtopic: Home Care
Protect aging skin. Avoid trauma such as bumping or pulling on skin areas. For a cut or scrape, use direct pressure to stop the bleeding.If you have a drug reaction, ask your health care provider about stopping the drug. Otherwise, follow your prescribed therapy to treat the underlying cause of the problem.

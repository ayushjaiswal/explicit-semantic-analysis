Surgery in the urinary tract or reproductive system and a bloodstream infection can also lead to a perirenal abscess.The biggest risk factor for perirenal abscess is kidney stones that block the flow of urine and provide a place for an infection to grow. Bacteria tend to stick to the stones and antibiotics can't kill the bacteria there.Stones are found in 20 - 60% of patients with perirenal abscess.

Title: Bladder stones

Bladder stones are hard buildups of minerals that form in the urinary bladder.

Subtopic: Causes
Bladder stones are usually caused by another urinary system problem, such as:Bladder diverticulumEnlarged prostateNeurogenic bladderUrinary tract infectionAlmost all bladder stones occur in men. Bladder stones are much less common than kidney stones.Bladder stones may occur when urine in the bladder is concentrated and materials crystallize. Bladder stones may also result from foreign objects in the bladder.

Subtopic: Symptoms
Symptoms occur when the stone irritates the lining of the bladder or blocks the flow of urine from the bladder. Symptoms can include:Abdominal pain, pressureAbnormally colored or dark-colored urineBlood in the urineDifficulty urinatingFrequent urge to urinateInability to urinate except in certain positionsInterruption of the urine streamPain, discomfort in the penisUrinary tract infection 

 
FeverPainful urination (dysuria)Urinary urgency 
 Loss of control over urine may also occur with bladder stones.

Subtopic: Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam, including a rectal examination. The exam may reveal an enlarged prostate or other problems.The following tests may be done:Bladder or pelvic x-ray CystoscopyUrinalysisUrine culture (clean catch) 

Subtopic: Treatment
Drinking 6 - 8 glasses of water or more per day to increase urination may help the stones pass if they are small.Your health care provider may remove stones that do not pass on their own using a cystoscope (a small tube that passes through the urethra to the bladder).Some stones may need to be removed using open surgery.Medications are rarely used to dissolve the stones.Causes of bladder stones should be treated. Most commonly bladder stones are seen with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH--enlarged prostate) or bladder outlet obstruction.For patients with BPH and bladder stones, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) can be performed with stone removal.

Subtopic: Outlook (Prognosis)
Most bladder stones are expelled or can be removed without permanent damage to the bladder. They may come back if the cause is not corrected.If the stones are left untreated, they may cause repeated urinary tract infections or permanent damage to the bladder or kidneys.

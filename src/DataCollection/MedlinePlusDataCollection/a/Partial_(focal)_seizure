Title: Partial (focal) seizure

All seizures are caused by abnormal electrical disturbances in the brain. Partial (focal) seizures occur when this electrical activity remains in a limited area of the brain. The seizures may sometimes turn into generalized seizures, which affect the whole brain. This is called secondary generalization.Partial seizures can be further characterized as:Simple -- not affecting awareness or memoryComplex -- affecting awareness or memory of events before, during, and immediately after the seizure, and affecting behaviorFor more information, see:EpilepsySeizuresGeneralized tonic clonic seizure (grand mal seizure)Petit mal seizure

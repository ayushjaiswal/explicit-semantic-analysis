Title: Volvulus - childhood

A volvulus is a twisting of the intestine that can occur in childhood. It causes a blockage, and may cut off blood flow and damage part of the intestine.

Subtopic: Causes
A birth defect called intestinal malrotation can make infants more likely to develop a volvulus. However, a volvulus can occur without malrotation.Volvulus due to malrotation often occurs early in life, usually in the first year.

Subtopic: Symptoms
Bloody or dark red stoolsConstipation or difficulty releasing stoolsDistended abdomenPain or tenderness in the abdomenNausea or vomitingShockVomiting green materialSymptoms are usually severe enough that infants are taken early to the emergency room, which can be critical for survival.

Subtopic: Exams and Tests
Barium enemaBlood tests to check electrolytesCT scanStool guaiac (shows blood in the stool)Upper GI

Subtopic: Treatment
Emergency surgery is needed to repair the volvulus. A surgical cut is made in the abdomen. The bowels are untwisted and the blood supply restored.If a small segment of bowel is dead from a lack of blood flow (necrotic), it is removed. The ends of the bowel are sewn back together. Or, they are used to form a connection of the intestines to the outside, through which bowel contents can be removed (colostomy or ileostomy).

Subtopic: Outlook (Prognosis)
Diagnosing and treating volvulus quickly generally leads to a good outcome.If the bowel is dead (necrotic), the outlook is poor. The situation may be life-threatening, depending on how much of the bowel is dead.

Subtopic: Possible Complications
Secondary peritonitisShort bowel syndrome (after removal of a large part of the small bowel)

Subtopic: When to Contact a Medical Professional

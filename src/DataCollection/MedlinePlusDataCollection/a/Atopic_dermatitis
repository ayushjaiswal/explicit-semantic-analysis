Title: Atopic dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis is a long-term (chronic) skin disorder that involves scaly and itchy rashes. Other forms of eczema include:Contact dermatitisDyshidrotic eczemaNummular eczemaSeborrheic dermatitis

Subtopic: Causes
Atopic dermatitis is due to a skin reaction (similar to an allergy) in the skin. The reaction leads to ongoing swelling and redness. People with atopic dermititis may be more sensitive because their skin lacks certain proteins.Atopic dermatitis is most common in infants. It may start as early as age 2 to 6 months. Many people outgrow it by early adulthood. People with atopic dermatitis often have asthma or seasonal allergies. There is often a family history of allergies such as asthma, hay fever, or eczema. People with atopic dermatitis often test positive to allergy skin tests.However, atopic dermatitis is not caused by allergies. The following can make atopic dermatitis symptoms worse:Allergies to pollen, mold, dust mites, or animalsCold and dry air in the winterColds or the fluContact with irritants and chemicalsContact with rough materials, such as woolDry skinEmotional stress Drying out of the skin from taking too many baths or showers and swimming too oftenGetting too hot or too cold, as well as sudden changes of temperaturePerfumes or dyes added to skin lotions or soaps

Subtopic: Symptoms
Skin changes may include:Blisters with oozing and crustingDry skin all over the body or areas of bumpy skin on the back of the arms and front of the thighsEar discharge or bleedingRaw areas of the skin from scratchingSkin coloring changes, such as more or less color than the normal skin tone Skin redness or inflammation around the blistersThickened or leather-like areas (called lichenification), which can occur after long-term irritation and scratchingThe type and location of the rash can depend on the age of the patient:In children younger than age 2, skin lesions begin on the face, scalp, hands, and feet. The rash is often itchy and bubble, ooze, or form crusts.In older children and adults, the rash is more often seen on the inside of the knees and elbow. It can also appear on the neck, hands, and feet.Rashes may occur anywhere on the body during a bad outbreak.Intense itching is common. Itching may start even before the rash appears. Atopic dermatitis is often called the "itch that rashes" because the itching starts, and then the skin rash follows as a result of scratching.

Subtopic: Exams and Tests
The health care provider will give you an exam and look at your skin. A physical exam will be done. You may need a skin biopsy  to confirm the diagnosis or rule out other causes of dry, itchy skin.Diagnosis is based on the:How the skin looksPersonal and family historyAllergy skin testing may be helpful for people with:Hard-to-treat atopic dermatitisOther allergy symptomsSkin rashes that form only on certain areas of the body after exposure to a specific chemical

Subtopic: Treatment
SKIN CARE AT HOMEDaily skin care make cut down on the need for medicines.Avoid scratching the rash or skin:Use a moisturizer, topical steroid cream, or other medicine your doctor prescribes.Take antihistamine medicines by mouth to reduce severe itching.Keep  fingernails cut short. Wear light gloves during sleep if nighttime scratching is a problem.Keep the skin moist (called lubricating or moisturizing the skin). Use ointments (such as petroleum jelly), creams, or lotions 2 - 3 times a day. Choose skin products that are free of alcohol, scents, dyes, and other chemicals. A humidifier to keep home air moist will also help.Avoid things that make your symptoms worse, such as:Foods that may cause an allergic reaction such as eggs in a very young child (always talk to your doctor first)Irritants such as wool and lanolinStrong soaps or detergents, as well as chemicals and solventsSudden changes in body temperature and stress, which may cause sweating Triggers that cause allergy symptomsWhen washing or bathing:Expose your skin to water for as short a time as possible. Short, cooler baths are better then long, hot baths. Use gentle body washes and cleansers instead of regular soaps. Do not scrub or dry the skin too hard or for too long.Apply lubricating creams, lotions, or ointment to the skin after bathing while it is damp. This will help trap moisture in the skin.MEDICATIONSAt this time, allergy shots are not used to treat atopic dermatitis.  Antihistamines taken by mouth may help with itching or allergies. You can often buy these medicines without a prescription. Most causes of atopic dermatitis are treated with medicines placed directly on the skin or scalp (called topical medicines):You will probably be prescribed a mild cortisone (or steroid) cream or ointment at first. You may need a stronger medicine if this doesn't work. Medicines called topical immunomodulators (TIMs) may be prescribed for anyone over 2 years old. TIMs include tacrolimus (protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel). Ask your doctor about concerns over a possible cancer risk with the use of these medicines.Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin may be used for thickened areas.Barrier repair creams containing ceramides may be used.Wet-wrap treatment with topical corticosteroids may help control the condition but may lead to an infection. Other treatments that may be used include:Antibiotic creams or pills if the skin is infectedDrugs that suppress the immune system, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetilPhototherapy, a medical treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet (UV) lightShort-term use of systemic steroids

Subtopic: Outlook (Prognosis)
Atopic dermatitis is a long-term condition. You can control it with treatment, by avoiding irritants, and by keeping the skin well-moisturized.In children, the condition often starts to go away around age 5 - 6, but flare-ups will often occur. In adults, the problem is generally a long-term or returning condition.Atopic dermatitis may be harder to control if it:Begins at an early ageInvolves a large amount of the bodyOccurs along with allergic rhinitis and asthmaOccurs in someone with a family history of eczema

Subtopic: Possible Complications
Infections of the skin caused by bacteria, fungi, or virusesPermanent scarsSide effects from long-term use of medicines to control eczema

Subtopic: When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call  your health care provider if:Atopic dermatitis does not get better with home care Symptoms get worse or treatment does not workYou have signs of infection (such as fever, redness, or pain)

Subtopic: Prevention
Children who are breast-fed until age 4 months are less likely to get atopic dermatitis.If a child is not breast-fed, using a formula that contains processed cow milk protein (called partially hydrolyzed formula) may cut down on the chances of developing atopic dermatitis.

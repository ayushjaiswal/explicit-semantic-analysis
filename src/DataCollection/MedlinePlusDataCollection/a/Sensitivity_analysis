Title: Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis determines the effectiveness of antibiotics against microorganisms (germs) such as bacteria that have been isolated from cultures.Sensitivity analysis may be done along with:Blood cultureClean catch urine culture or catheterized specimen urine cultureSputum cultureCulture from endocervixThroat cultureWound and other cultures 

Subtopic: How the Test is Performed
After the culture (sample) is collected from a person, it is sent to a lab. There, the samples are put in special containers to grow the microorganisms (germs) from the collected samples. Colonies of microorganisms are combined with different antibiotics to see how well each antibiotic stops each colony from growing. The test determines how effective each antibiotic is against a given organism.

Subtopic: How to Prepare for the Test
Follow your health care provider's instructions on how to prepare for the method used to obtain the culture.

Subtopic: How the Test Will Feel
The way the test feels depends on the method used to obtain the culture.

Subtopic: Why the Test is Performed
The test shows which antibiotic drugs should be used to treat an infection.Many organisms are resistant to certain antibiotics. So, sensitivity tests are important in helping find the right antibiotic for you. Your health care provider may start you on one antibiotic, but later change you to another because of the results of sensitivity analysis.

Subtopic: What Abnormal Results Mean
If the organism shows resistance to the antibiotics used in the test, those antibiotics will not be effective treatment.

Subtopic: Risks
The risks depend upon the method used for obtaining the specific culture.

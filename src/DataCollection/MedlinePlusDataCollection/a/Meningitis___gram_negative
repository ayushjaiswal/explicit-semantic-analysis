Title: Meningitis - gram-negative

Gram-negative meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges) from bacteria that turn pink when exposed to a special stain (Gram-negative bacteria).

Subtopic: Causes
Acute bacterial meningitis can be caused by Gram-negative bacteria. Meningococcal and H. influenzae meningitis are due to Gram-negative bacteria and are covered in detail in other articles. This article covers bacteria causing Gram-negative meningitis due to the following common causes: 
 Escherichia coliKlebsiella pneumoniaePseudomonas aeruginosaSerratia marsescensGram-negative meningitis is more common in infants than adults, but is of growing importance in adults, especially those with one or more risk factors. Risk factors in adults and children include:Local infectionRecent brain surgeryRecent injury to the headSpinal abnormalitiesSpinal fluid shunt placement after brain surgeryUrinary tract abnormalitiesUrinary tract infectionWeakened immune system

Subtopic: Symptoms
Fever and chillsMental status changesNausea and vomitingSensitivity to light (photophobia)Severe headacheStiff neck (meningismus)Symptoms of a bladder, kidney, intestine, or lung infectionOther symptoms that can occur with this disease:AgitationBulging fontanelles in infants
 Decreased consciousnessPoor feeding or irritability in childrenRapid breathingUnusual posture, with the head and neck arched backwards (opisthotonos)

Subtopic: Exams and Tests
The doctor or nurse will examine you. This will usually show:Fast heart rateFeverMental status changesStiff neckIf the health care provider thinks you may have meningitis, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) should be done to remove a sample of spinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF) for testing.Other tests that may be done include:Blood cultureChest x-rayCT scan of the headThis list is not all-inclusive. 


Subtopic: Treatment
Antibiotics should be started as soon as possible. Ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or cefepime are the most commonly used antibiotics for this type of meningitis. Other antibiotics may be used, depending on the type of bacteria. 
 If you have a spinal shunt, it may be removed.

Subtopic: Outlook (Prognosis)
The early treatment is started, the better the outcome. Many people recover completely, but a large number of people have permanent brain damage or die from this type of meningitis. Young children and adults over age 50 have the highest risk of death. How well you do depends on:AgeHow quickly the infection is treatedOverall health

Subtopic: Possible Complications
Brain damageBuildup of fluid between the skull and brain (subdural effusion)Hearing lossHydrocephalusSeizures

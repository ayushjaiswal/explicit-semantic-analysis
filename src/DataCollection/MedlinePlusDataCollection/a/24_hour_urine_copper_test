A 24-hour urine sample is needed.On day 1, urinate into the toilet when you get up in the morning.Afterwards, collect all urine in a special container for the next 24 hours.On day 2, urinate into the container when you get up in the morning.Cap the container.

For an infant, thoroughly wash the area where urine exits the body. Open a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end). For boys, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive to the skin. For girls, place the bag over the labia. Diaper as usual over the secured bag.This procedure may take a couple of attempts. Lively infants can move the bag, causing the urine to be absorbed by the diaper.

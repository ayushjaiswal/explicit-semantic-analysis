Title: Bile culture

A bile culture is a laboratory test to detect disease-causing microorganisms in the biliary system, which includes the gallbladder, bile ducts inside the liver, and bile ducts outside the liver.See also: Bile

Subtopic: How the Test is Performed
A sample of bile (a digestive fluid) is needed. This can be done using different methods, including gallbladder surgery or a scope procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).For information on those procedures, see:ERCPGallbladder surgeryThe bile fluid sample is sent to a laboratory, where it is stored in a special dish (called a culture medium). The laboratory team watches to see if any bacteria, virus, or fungus grows on the sample.

Subtopic: How to Prepare for the Test
Preparation depends on the specific method used to obtain the bile sample.See also:ERCPGallbladder surgery

Subtopic: How the Test Will Feel
A culture does not involve the patient, so there is no pain.See also:ERCPGallbladder surgery

Subtopic: Why the Test is Performed
This test is done to detect infection within the biliary system. The biliary system creates, moves, stores, and releases bile to help in digestion.

Subtopic: Normal Results
The test result is normal if no bacteria, virus, or fungus grew in the laboratory dish.Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.

Subtopic: What Abnormal Results Mean
An abnormal result means bacteria, fungus, or virus grew in the laboratory dish. This may be a sign of infection.

Subtopic: Risks
A culture itself does not involve the patient, so there are no risks.Other risks depend on the method used to take a sample of the bile.

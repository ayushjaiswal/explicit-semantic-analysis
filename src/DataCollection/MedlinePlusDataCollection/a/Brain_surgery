Title: Brain surgery

Brain surgery is a procedure to treat problems in the brain and the surrounding structures.

Subtopic: Description
Before surgery, the hair on part of the scalp is shaved, and the area is cleaned. The doctor makes a surgical cut through the scalp. The location of this cut depends on where the problem in the brain is located.The surgeon creates a hole in the skull and removes a piece, called a bone flap.If possible, the surgeon will make a smaller hole and insert a tube with a light and camera on the end. This is called an endoscope. The surgery will be done with tools placed through the endoscope. MRI or CT can help guide the doctor to the proper place in the brain.During surgery, your surgeon may:Clip off an aneurysm to prevent blood flowRemove a tumor or a piece of tumor for a biopsyRemove abnormal brain tissueDrain blood or an infectionThe bone flap is usually replaced after surgery, using small metal plates, sutures, or wires. The bone flap may not be put back if your surgery involved a tumor or an infection, or if the brain was swollen. (This is called a craniectomy.)The time it takes for the surgery depends on the problem being treated.

Title: Concussion

A concussion is a minor traumatic brain injury that may occur when the head hits an object, or a moving object strikes the head.It can affect how the brain works for a while. A concussion can lead to a bad headache, changes in alertness, or loss of consciousness. 

Subtopic: Causes
A concussion can result from a fall, sports activities, or car accidents. A big movement of the brain (called jarring) in any direction can cause a person to lose alertness (become unconscious). How long the person stays unconscious may be a sign of the severity of the concussion.Concussions do not always result in loss of consciousness. Most people who have a concussion never pass out. But they may describe seeing all white, black, or stars. A person can also have a concussion and not realize it.Watch this video about:Concussion


Subtopic: Symptoms
Symptoms of a concussion range from mild to severe. They can include:Acting confused, feeling spacey, or not thinking straightBeing drowsy, hard to wake up, or similar changesHeadacheLoss of consciousnessMemory loss (amnesia) of events before the injury or right afterNausea and vomitingSeeing flashing lightsFeeling like you have "lost time"The following are emergency symptoms of a concussion. Seek medical care right away if there are:Changes in alertness and consciousnessConfusion that does not go awayConvulsions (seizures)Muscle weakness on one or both sidesPersistent confusionPupils of the eyes that are not equal in sizeRemaining unconsciousness (coma)Repeated vomitingUnequal pupilsUnusual eye movementsWalking or balance problemsUnconsciousness (coma) that continuesHead injuries that cause a concussion often occur with injury to the neck and spine. Take special care when moving people who have had a head injury.While recovering from a concussion, the person may:Be withdrawn, easily upset, or confusedHave a hard time with tasks that require remembering or concentratingHave mild headachesBe less tolerant of noiseBe very tired

Subtopic: Exams and Tests
The doctor will perform a physical exam. The person's nervous system will be checked. There may be changes in the person's pupil size, thinking ability, coordination, and reflexes.Tests that may be ordered include:EEG (brain wave test) may be needed if seizures continueHead CT scanMRI of the brain

Subtopic: Treatment
A more serious head injury that involves bleeding or brain damage must be treated in a hospital.For a mild head injury no treatment may be needed. But be aware that the symptoms of a head injury can show up later.Friends or family may need to keep an eye on adults for symptoms after they are released from the emergency room or doctor’s office.Parents or caregivers of children need to keep an eye on a child for symptoms after a head injury.Both adults and children must follow the health care provider’s instructions about when the person can return to sports.After even a mild concussion:Do not do activities that can cause further head injury.Avoid tasks that require concentration or complicated thinking. These include reading, homework, and preparing reports.Avoid bright lights and loud sounds. These can overstimulate the brain.

Subtopic: Outlook (Prognosis)
Recovering from a concussion takes time. It may take days, weeks, or even months. The person have trouble concentrating and may be unable to remember things. The person may be irritable, have headaches, dizziness, blurry vision, and nausea that comes and goes.Adults should get help from family or friends before making important decisions. This is because reasoning and thinking processes may be impaired.In a small group of patients, symptoms of the concussion do not go away. The risk of long-term changes in the brain is high if the person has more than one brain injurySeizures may occur after more severe head injuries.

Title: Multifocal atrial tachycardia

Multifocal atrial tachycardia is a rapid heart rate that occurs when too many signals (electrical impulses) are sent from the upper heart (atria) to the lower heart (ventricles).

Subtopic: Causes
The human heart gives off electrical impulses, or signals, which tell it to beat. Normally, these signals begin in an area of the upper right chamber called the sinoatrial node (sinus node or SA node). This node is considered the heart's "natural pacemaker." It helps control the heartbeat. When the heart detects a signal, it contracts (or beats). The normal heart rate in adults is about 60 to 100 beats per minute. The normal heart rate is faster in children.In multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), multiple locations in the atria fire signals at the same time. Too many signals lead to a rapid heart rate -- usually from 100 to 130 beats per minute in adults. The rapid heart rate causes the heart to work too hard and inefficiently. If the heartbeat is very fast, the heart has less time to fill up with blood, so it doesn't have the right amount of blood to pump to the brain and the rest of the body.MAT is most common in people age 50 and over. It is often seen in people with conditions that lower the amount of oxygen in the blood. These conditions include:Bacterial pneumoniaChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)Congestive heart failureLung cancerLung failurePulmonary embolismYou may be at higher risk for MAT if you have:Coronary heart diseaseDiabetesHad surgery within the last 6 weeksOverdosed on the drug theophyllineSepsisWhen the heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, the arrhythmia is called "wandering atrial pacemaker."

Subtopic: Symptoms
Some people may have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include:Chest tightnessLight-headednessFaintingSensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations)Shortness of breathWeight loss and failure to thrive in infantsOther symptoms that can occur with this disease:Breathing difficulty when lying downDizziness

Subtopic: Exams and Tests
An examination shows a fast irregular heartbeat, usually of 100 to 130 beats per minute. Blood pressure is normal or low. There may be signs of poor circulation.Tests to diagnose MAT include:ECGElectrophysiologic study (EPS)Heart monitors are used to record the rapid heartbeat. These include:24-hour Holter monitorPortable, long-term loop recorders -- allow you to start recording if symptoms occurIf you are in the hospital, your heart rhythm will be monitored 24 hours a day

Subtopic: Treatment
If you have a condition that can lead to MAT, that condition should be treated first.Treatment for MAT includes:Improving blood oxygen levelsGiving magnesium or potassium through a veinStopping medications, such as theophylline, which can increase the heart rateTaking medicines to slow the heart rate (if the heart rate is too fast), such as such as calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) or beta-blockers

Subtopic: Outlook (Prognosis)
MAT can be controlled if the condition that causes the rapid heartbeat is treated and controlled.

Subtopic: Possible Complications
CardiomyopathyCongestive heart failureReduced pumping action of the heart

Subtopic: When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call your health care provider if:You have a rapid or irregular heartbeat with other MAT symptomsYou have MAT and your symptoms get worse, do not improve with treatment, or you develop new symptoms

Subtopic: Prevention
To reduce the risk of developing MAT, promptly treat the disorders that cause it.

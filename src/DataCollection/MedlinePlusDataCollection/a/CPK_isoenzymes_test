Title: CPK isoenzymes test

The CPK isoenzymes test measures the different forms of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in the blood. CPK is an enzyme found mainly in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle.

Subtopic: How the Test is Performed
A blood sample is needed. This may be taken from a vein. The test is called a venipuncture.If you are in the hospital, this test may be repeated over 2 or 3 days. A significant rise or fall in the total CPK or CPK isoenzymes can help your health care provider diagnosis certain conditions.

Subtopic: How to Prepare for the Test
Usually, no special preparation is necessary.Tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking. Certain medications can interfere with test results. Drugs that can increase CPK measurements include the following:AlcoholAmphotericin BCertain anestheticsCocaineFibrate drugsStatinsSteroids such as dexamethasoneThis list is not all-inclusive.

Subtopic: How the Test Will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel moderate pain, or only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.

Subtopic: Why the Test is Performed
This test is done if a CPK test reveals that your total CPK level is elevated. CPK isoenzyme testing can help pinpoint the exact source of the damaged tissue.CPK is made of three slightly different substances:CPK-1 (also called CPK-BB) is found mostly in the brain and lungsCPK-2 (also called CPK-MB) is found mostly in the heartCPK-3 (also called CPK-MM) is found mostly in skeletal muscle

Subtopic: What Abnormal Results Mean
Higher-than-normal CPK-1 levels:Because CPK-1 is found mostly in the brain and lungs, injury to either of these areas can increase CPK-1 levels. Increased CPK-1 levels may be due to:Brain cancerBrain injury (due to injury, stroke, or bleeding in the brain)Electroconvulsive therapyPulmonary infarctionSeizureHigher-than-normal CPK-2 levels:CPK-2 levels rise 3 - 6 hours after a heart attack. If there is no further heart muscle damage, the level peaks at 12 - 24 hours and returns to normal 12 - 48 hours after tissue death.Increased CPK-2 levels may also be due to:Electrical injuriesHeart defibrillation (purposeful shocking of the heart by medical personnel)Heart injury (for instance, from a car accident)Inflammation of the heart muscle usually due to a virus (myocarditis)Open heart surgeryCPK-2 levels do NOT usually rise with chest pain caused by angina, pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung), or congestive heart failure.Higher-than-normal CPK-3 levels are usually a sign of muscle injury or muscle stress and may be due to:Crush injuriesMuscle damage due to drugs or being immobile for a long time (rhabdomyolysis)Muscular dystrophyMyositis (skeletal muscle inflammation)Receiving many intramuscular injectionsRecent nerve and muscle function testing (electromyography)Recent seizuresRecent surgeryStrenuous exercise

Subtopic: Considerations
Factors that can affect test results include cardiac catheterization, intramuscular injections, recent surgery, and vigorous and prolonged exercise or immobilization.Isoenzyme testing for specific conditions is about 90% accurate.

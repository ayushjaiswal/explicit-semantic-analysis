Title: Sputum stain for mycobacteria

Sputum stain for mycobacteria is a test to check for a type of bacteria that cause tuberculosis and other infections.

Subtopic: How the Test is Performed
This test requires a sample of sputum. To do this, you will be be asked to cough deeply and spit the substance that comes up from the lungs (sputum) into a container.You may be asked to breath in a mist of salty steam. This makes you cough more deeply and produce sputum.If you still don't produce enough sputum, you might have a bronchoscopy. The test sample is examined under a microscope. Another test, called a culture, is done to confirm the results. A culture test takes a few days to get results. This sputum test can give your doctor a quick, early answer. 

Subtopic: How to Prepare for the Test
It can help to drink a lot of fluids the night before the test. It makes the test more accurate if it's done first thing in the morning.

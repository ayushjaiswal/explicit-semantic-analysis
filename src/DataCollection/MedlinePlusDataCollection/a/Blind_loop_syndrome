Title: Blind loop syndrome

Blind loop syndrome occurs when part of the intestine becomes bypassed. Digested food slows or stops moving through part of the intestines. This causes bacteria to grow too much in the intestines and leads to problems in absorbing nutrients.

Subtopic: Causes
The name of this condition refers to the "blind loop" formed by the bypassed intestine. This blind loop does not allow digested food to flow normally through the intestinal tract.When a section of the intestine is affected by blind loop syndrome, the bile salts needed to digest fats become ineffective. This leads to fatty stools and poor absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin B12 deficiency may occur because the extra bacteria that develop in this situation use up all of the vitamin.Blind loop syndrome is a complication that occurs:After many operations, including subtotal gastrectomy (surgical removal of part of the stomach) and operations for extreme obesityAs a complication of inflammatory bowel diseaseDiseases such as diabetes or scleroderma may slow down movement in a segment of the intestine, leading to blind loop syndrome.

Subtopic: Symptoms
DiarrheaFatty stoolsFullness after a mealLoss of appetiteNauseaUnintentional weight loss

Subtopic: Exams and Tests
During a physical examination, the doctor may notice a mass in, or swelling of, the abdomen. Possible tests include:Abdominal CT scanAbdominal x-rayBlood tests to check nutritional statusUpper GI series with small bowel follow through contrast x-ray

Subtopic: Treatment
Treatment generally starts with antibiotics for the excess bacteria growth, along with vitamin B12 supplements. If antibiotics don't work, surgery to help the food flow through the intestine may be considered.

Subtopic: Outlook (Prognosis)
Many patients get better with antibiotics. If surgical repair is needed, the outcome isÂ usually very good.

Subtopic: Possible Complications
Complete intestinal obstructionDeath of intestine (intestinal infarction)Hole (perforation) in intestineMalabsorption and malnutrition

Title: Opisthotonos

Opisthotonos is a condition in which the body is held in an abnormal position. The person is usually rigid and arches the back, with the head thrown backward. If a person with opisthotonos lies on his or her back, only the back of the head and the heels touch the supporting surface.See: Abnormal posturing

Subtopic: Considerations
Opisthotonos is much more common in infants and children than in adults. It is also more exaggerated in infants and children because of their less mature nervous systems.

Subtopic: Causes
Opisthotonos may occur in infants with meningitis. It may also occur as a sign of reduced brain function or injury to the nervous system.Other causes may include:Arnold-Chiari syndrome (a problem with the structure of the brain)Brain tumorGaucher diseaseGrowth hormone deficiency (occasionally)Glutaric aciduria and organic acidemias (forms of chemical poisoning)Krabbe DiseaseSeizuresSevere electrolyte imbalanceSevere head injuryStiff-person syndrome (a condition that makes a person rigid and have spasms)Subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain)TetanusDrugs such as phenothiazines and other antipsychotic medications, can cause a side effect called acute dystonic reaction. Opisthotonos may be part of this reaction.In rare cases, infants born to women who drink large amounts of alcohol during pregnancy may have opisthotonus due to alcohol withdrawal.

Subtopic: Home Care
A person who develops opisthotonos will need to be cared for in a hospital.

Subtopic: When to Contact a Medical Professional
Go to the emergency room or call your local emergency number (such as 911) if this symptom occurs. Typically opisthotonos is a symptom of other conditions that are serious enough for a person to seek medical attention.

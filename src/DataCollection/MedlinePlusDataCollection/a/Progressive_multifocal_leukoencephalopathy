Title: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare disorder that damages the material (myelin) that covers and protects nerves in the white matter of the brain.

Subtopic: Causes
The JC virus (JCV) causes PML. By age 10, most people have been infected with this virus, but it hardly ever causes symptoms.Anyone with a weakened immune system, however, are at greater risk of developing PML. Causes of a weakened immune system include:AIDS (less common now because of better AIDS treatments)Certain medications used to treat multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and related conditionsLeukemia and lymphoma

Subtopic: Symptoms
HeadachesLoss of coordination, clumsinessLoss of language ability (aphasia)Memory lossVision problemsWeakness of the legs and arms that gets worse

Subtopic: Exams and Tests
Tests may include:Brain biopsy (rare)Cerebrospinal fluid test for the JCVCT scan of the brainElectroencephalogram (EEG)MRI of the brain

Subtopic: Treatment
In people with AIDS, treatment to strengthen the immune system can lead to recovery from the symptoms of PML. No other treatments have proved effective for PML.

Subtopic: Outlook (Prognosis)
PML is a life-threatening condition. Talk to your doctor about care decisions.

Title: Blastomycosis

Blastomycosis is an infection caused by breathing in the Blastomyces dermatitidis fungus. The fungus is found in wood and soil.

Subtopic: Causes
You can get blastomyocosis by contact with moist soil, most commonly where there is rotting wood and leaves. The fungus enters the body through the lungs, where the infection starts. The fungus then spreads to other parts of the body. The disease may affect the skin, bones and joints, and other areas.Blastomycosis is rare. It is found in the central and southeastern United States, and in Canada, India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Africa.The key risk factor for the disease is contact with infected soil. It most often affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV or who have had an organ transplant. Men are more likely to be affected than women.

Next, a flexible tube with a camera on the (sigmoidoscope) is placed through the anus. The scope is gently moved into your colon. Air is inserted into the colon to enlarge the area and help the doctor see better. The air may cause the urge to have a bowel movement or pass gas. Suction may be used to remove fluid or stool.The doctor may take tissue samples with a tiny biopsy tool inserted through the scope.  Heat (electrocautery) may be used to remove polyps. Images of the inside of your colon may be taken.  Sigmoidoscopy using a rigid scope may be done to treat problems of the anus or rectum.

Title: Swelling

Swelling is the enlargement of organs, skin, or other body parts. It is caused by a buildup of fluid in the tissues. The extra fluid can lead to a rapid increase in weight over a short period of time (days to weeks).Swelling can occur all over the body (generalized) or only in one part of the body (localized).

Subtopic: Considerations
Slight swelling (edema) of the lower legs is common in warm summer months, especially if a person has been standing or walking a lot.General swelling, or massive edema (also called anasarca), is a common sign in people who are very sick. Although slight edema may be hard to detect, a large amount of swelling is very obvious.Edema is described as pitting or non-pitting.Pitting edema leaves a dent in the skin after you press the area with a finger for about 5 seconds. The dent will slowly fill back in.Non-pitting edema does not leave this type of dent when pressing on the swollen area.
